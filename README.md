# Silenus - WORK IN PROGRESS
Review and vote on your favourite restaurants and bars among friends!

# Description
This is a work in progress, but currently you can create an account, add reviews (with the aid of the Google Maps API) and view/edit them. They need a bit of testing, but afterwards I will be adding a friends system and a group system. You will be able to vote on where you would like to go out on a certain date, either for lunch or a night out (or even breakfast), by each of you putting forward an option!  For now, please see the below screen shots for the current progress.  You can view the code too.

I should say, just in case, please drink responsibly. This is an app for having a good time, either at a nice restaurant, or a pub, or a bar, or even bowling or an arcade.  The emphasis here is that you should have good time, which can and should be done sensibly!
